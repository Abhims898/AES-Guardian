AES Encryption Web Application

A secure web-based implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with an intuitive interface for real-time encryption and decryption operations.


Key Features

üîí AES-256-CBC Encryption: Industry-standard symmetric encryption

üîë Flexible Key Handling: Accepts keys of any length (auto-converted via SHA-256)

üìã Clipboard Integration: One-click copy for encrypted/decrypted results

‚öôÔ∏è Adaptive Key Sizing: Supports 128/192/256-bit keys with automatic negotiation

üì± Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly interface



Technology Stack

Backend: Python (PyCryptodome)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Server: Python HTTP.server

Security: AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding and random IV generation

Usage

Encryption Tab:

Enter plaintext in the input field

Provide any secret key

Click "Encrypt" to generate Base64-encoded ciphertext

Decryption Tab:

Paste Base64 ciphertext

Enter the original secret key

Click "Decrypt" to recover the original message


Security Features

SHA-256 key derivation from any input

Random 16-byte IV for each encryption

PKCS#7 padding validation

Secure CBC mode implementation

Server-side key zeroization after processing
